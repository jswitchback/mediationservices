DESCRIPTION
-----------

This module provides the Magnific Popup as an additional formatter for image core field,
to link to an image style, as well as classes to initialize the popup for inline and iframe elements.


INSTALLATION
------------

1) Place this module directory in your "modules" folder (this will usually be
   "sites/all/modules/"). Don't install your module in Drupal core's "modules"
   folder, since that will cause problems and is bad practice in general. If
   "sites/all/modules" doesn't exist yet, just create it.

2) Enable the module.
